If you do not have Git configured to authenticate with GitHub, [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is likely the easiest way to get started

To ensure that it's properly installed, please `git pull` the main branch of this repository.

### Flow CLI

If you have homebrew:

```sh
brew install flow-cli
```

Otherwise, you'll have to follow the instructions [here](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-cli/install)

To ensure it's properlly installed, please run the following:

```sh
flow version
```

This should show you the latest version of the Flow CLI

### Google Cloud SDK

If you have homebrew:


```sh
brew install --cask google-cloud-sdk
```

Otherwise, you'll have to follow the instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
